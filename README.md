# a8-demo

This is "more or less" the code introduced in this [tutorial](https://nytrosecurity.com/2018/05/30/understanding-java-deserialization/)

It includes a compromised serialized file (compromisedLog.ser), made with the ysoserial tool, so you do not need to download this tool.
Use this file for the last part of the tutorial.
